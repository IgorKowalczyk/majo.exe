## 🆕 Submitting Contributions

We know that contributing to a project can be intimidating, especially if you are new to the community. However, we want to assure you that **contributing to Majo.exe is easy and fun**.

We have created a welcoming community that encourages collaboration and supports new contributors. **We are excited to have you on board!** 🙌

### 1. Choose existing issues or create your own 📝

Start by **reviewing the existing issues** to identify areas where your contributions **can make a significant impact**.

If you **have new features, enhancements, or bug fixes in mind**, you can create a **new issue** to propose your contributions. **Please provide comprehensive details to clearly explain your ideas.** This will help the project maintainers and fellow contributors to understand your suggestions and provide valuable feedback.

### 2. Fork the repository 🍴

To initiate your contribution, **fork the primary repository by clicking the "Fork" button.** This creates a copy of the repository in your personal GitHub account. You will use this copy to make and propose changes to the project.

![Forking igorkowalczyk/majo.exe repository on Github](https://github.com/IgorKowalczyk/majo.exe/assets/49127376/dfaedc7f-5a59-4332-b19b-5305d1c78935)

After forking the repository, **clone your forked repository to your local development environment** using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/majo.exe.git
cd majo.exe
```

This creates a local copy of your forked repository on your computer in directory `majo.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username

### 3. Set up the upstream remote ☝️

To keep your forked repository in sync with the primary repository, **set up the upstream remote** using the following command:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/IgorKowalczyk/majo.exe
git remote -v
```

### 4. Create a new branch 🔗

Before you can start working on your contribution, **create a new branch dedicated to your specific task**:

```bash
git checkout -b my-contribution
```

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `my-contribution` with a descriptive name that clearly identifies the purpose of your branch. Please use lowercase letters and hyphens instead of spaces.

### 5. Make Changes 🔥

Now you can start working on your contribution! Implement your awesome ideas, fix bugs, or add new features. **Be creative and have fun!** Ensure your contributions are well-structured, documented, and aligned with the project's objectives.

**Quick Tip:** To keep your forked repository in sync with the primary repository, **pull the latest changes** from the primary repository before making your contributions:

```bash
git pull upstream main
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to test your changes before submitting them! **You can read the [README.md](https://github.com/igorkowalczyk/majo.exe/blob/master/README.md) file for instructions on how to set up the project locally.**

**Please provide comprehensive details to clearly explain your changes.** This will help the project maintainers and fellow contributors to understand your contributions and provide valuable feedback.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
