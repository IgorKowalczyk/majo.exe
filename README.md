> Currently Nyxia is not online/available to be added to your server *just yet* but will be in the future so keep an eye on this message!

> TsukiyoDev Team and fellow devs will not provide assistance with self-hosting. This repo is meant for developer-to-user transparency, contributions and further development. Nyxia is not designed with self-hosting in mind but if you want to try feel free to give it a shot, just know we will not provide support for any issues you may have so you are on your own.
